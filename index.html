<h1>THIS WEB PAGE IS RUNNING A CRYPTO MINER</h1>
        <h2>If you are on a managed network, it won't work!</h2>
<p>This is a java script miner test and is constantly under devlopment</p>
<p>This is just a small test to see if I can get a javascript miner to run</p>
<p>Im still trying to upgrade this with a current hashes per second meter and how much it made, if you can tell me how to do it that would be nice!</p>
<p>If you have a better javascript miner then the one I have (it has %12 tax!) then put it on github and put the link in my "issues" secion</p>
<p>To give advice goto https://github.com/Criptc/Test-site/issues</p>
